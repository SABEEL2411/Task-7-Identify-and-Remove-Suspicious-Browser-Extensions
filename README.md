# Interview Questions – Browser Extensions Security

## 1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
Browser extensions can:
- Access sensitive data like passwords, browsing history, and cookies.
- Inject malicious scripts into web pages.
- Track user activity and behavior.
- Communicate with remote servers and leak information.
- Act as keyloggers or phishing tools if maliciously designed.

## 2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
Be cautious if an extension asks for:
- **Access to all websites** (`Read and change all your data on the websites you visit`)
- **Clipboard access**
- **File system access**
- **Webcam/microphone access**
- **Background operation** (running even when not in use)
These permissions are powerful and often unnecessary for simple extensions.

## 3. How to safely install browser extensions?
- Only install from official sources (Chrome Web Store / Mozilla Add-ons).
- Read user reviews and check the number of active users.
- Review requested permissions before installing.
- Avoid installing extensions from random links or third-party websites.

## 4. What is extension sandboxing?
Extension sandboxing is a security technique where each extension runs in its **own isolated environment**.
- Prevents extensions from interfering with browser core processes.
- Restricts access to the operating system or other extensions.
- Limits the damage a malicious extension can do.

## 5. Can extensions steal passwords?
Yes. Malicious extensions can:
- Log keystrokes (keylogging)
- Read data from password fields
- Intercept login forms or autofill data
- Steal cookies/session tokens and hijack sessions

Always verify the developer and permissions before trusting an extension.

## 6. How to update extensions securely?
- Enable **automatic updates** in browser settings.
- Update manually from the official extension page if needed.
- Never download "updates" from pop-ups or suspicious websites.
- Regularly audit your extensions and remove outdated ones.

## 7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
| Feature          | Extension                          | Plugin                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Definition        | Adds features to the browser       | Adds support for specific content types |
| Examples          | Ad blockers, password managers     | Flash, Java plugins (deprecated)   |
| Installation      | From browser store                 | Installed system-wide              |
| Security Model    | Sandboxed                          | Higher privileges (more risky)     |
| Current Usage     | Still widely used                  | Mostly deprecated in modern browsers |

## 8. How to report malicious extensions?
- Go to the extension’s page in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site.

- Provide a description of suspicious behavior.
- You can also report to **CERT-In (India)** or **Google/Mozilla** security teams.
